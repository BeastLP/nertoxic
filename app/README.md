# What is this folder?
This folder allows developer to override, change and impliment code into our core system. Since we dont allow
to make any changes into the core-source you can go here and impliment your own code. These files are loaded
during the preload of the page, so you can just touch and edit the most functions/files our core system provide.

Notice: Some functions are untouchable by your, so you might get some errors while trying to edit some core code.
